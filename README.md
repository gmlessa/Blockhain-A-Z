# Blockhain-A-Z
Creating a Blockchain, a Cryptocurrency and a Smart Contract with the knowledgment aquired in the Udemy Course: Blockchain A-Zâ„¢: Learn How To Build Your First Blockchain

In the first module(Blockchain), I created a Blockchain enviroment and a Web App using Python and was able to interact with the Blockchain using Postman. In that way i was able to:
- get the blockhain,
- mine a block,
 -check if the block was valid, while ensuring everything was cryptographed using SHA256 hash functions.
In the second module(Cryptocurrency), I created a fictional crypotcurrency called Guscoin, and simulated a descentralized enviroment with 3 nodes and connecting all of them in the Blockchain and keeping it uptaded with the consensus of the longest chain being the valid one. In addition with the functionalities described above, I was able to:
 -add nodes, 
-make transactions, 
-create a descentralized network and connect the nodes, 
-replace chain with the longest chain in the network and make the blockchain syncronized.

In the third module(Smart Contract) I created a Smart Contract for buying and selling Guscoins (fictional cryptocurrency created in the second module) with Solidity using Remix IDE, and deployed to Ganache (a blockchain framework) using My Ether Wallet. Then, I was able to:
 -Interact with the blockchain using the functions created in the Smart Contract, 
-Use a private key of an account in Ganache to deploy and make transactions,
 -See the transactions in Ganache.
